Today we are learing Signal handling. we are learing this because we want to know the exit status of child when it terminate. when we were using wait() or waitpid()
we are facing problems that we are not able to do task cocurrently.otherwise child will become zombie. to avoid this problem we need to introduce the concept of 
signal handling so that whenever  the child change its status parent will get notification and parent will take appropriate action.
this problem can be avoid by two ways.
1) by polling method
2) by signal handling or interrupt Service routine

when child exit it throws signal no. SIGCHLD(17).
