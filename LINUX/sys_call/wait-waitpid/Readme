if we write wait() in starting  of program then parent will wait for child's status.Parenet will procceed after child will change its status. 
In this condition prcocess are not working cocurrently.

if we write wait() at end of program then child may become zombie. 
Parent and child should work  cocurrently and child should should not become orphane and zombie.
/* Prog1 and prog2 is the example of this */

Every new child had new copy of data variable data. Data will change only with respect to that process other process will not affect.
Any change in parent data will not affect the child data and vice-versa.
This concept is know as "Copy-On-Write".
A seperate addspace is made availabe,if data is attempeted to modify.
/* data_protect.c is example of that  */
