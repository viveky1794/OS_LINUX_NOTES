When we  run prog1.c we found that segmentation fault(core dump) error came. why? 
it came because that func is recurcessively calling and every copy of this call holds the array of 1 million bytes and this array is taking palce into stack area of RAM.
So the question is what is the size of stack. how can we know it.

for this type a command on terminal $ ulimit -a
it will give the features of resoreces dafalt value.So we find there that the size of stack is 8Mb=8 million this the reasone prog1.c cnt upto 8 only after the size of stack is exahaust and process ternibate abnormally.

So that in the normal conditions stack size can be less then the size of stack.

Now question came that can be increase the size? YES

then how ?

we do with the help of getrlimit() and setrlimit(). SEE prog2.c
