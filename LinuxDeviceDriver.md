### Learn About Makefile :

 1: [Open Source Link](https://opensourceforu.com/?s=device+driver)
 
 + -> [Same Author but Other Link](https://sysplay.github.io/books/LinuxDrivers/book/Content/Part13.html)
    
   + -> This link will provide you information about device drivers. It has nu mber of articals.
        I am still trying to read them then update more about this .....       
        What articals i have read in this series of Linux Device Drivers. i have mentioned them all.
        
   + -> To know about makefile  Read [this](http://opensourceforu.com/2012/06/gnu-make-in-detail-for-beginners)

    1 : $ vim Makefile
    
       --->>> Wite only one line 
              obj-m := testUSB.o
              
       --->>> Comeout from this Makefile
       
    /* Run make command as root user. A simple space can make your life hell and spend many hours. Above vedio must watch */
   
   2 : $ make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD modules
   
   3 : $ insmod <name of Driver.ko>
   4 : dmesg
   5 : $ rmmode <name of Driver.ko>
